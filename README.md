# cht-gpt-video-editor

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ts-fciqik)

This is an experiment to create a video editor while assisted by Chat-GPT

## Prompts

This is the original prompt

> create a web page, with a vite and typescript setup, on which the user can record video clips, crop, zoom and cut the clips and arrange them in a timeline

I will attempt to export the discussion as the project takes shape.
